### Implementation Summary
Core schema implementation completed with the following deliverables:

**Files Created:**
- `migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` - Complete database schema
- `migrations/001_initial_schema_rollback.sql` - Rollback migration  
- `migrations/run_migration.sh` - Migration runner script
- `migrations/validate_schema.sql` - Schema validation and testing
- `schema/README.md` - Comprehensive schema documentation

**Features Implemented:**
- ✅ All core tables (events, speakers, companies, topics)
- ✅ Relationship tables (event_speakers, event_companies, event_topics)
- ✅ Foreign key constraints with CASCADE DELETE
- ✅ Vector column for embeddings (pgvector integration)
- ✅ Comprehensive indexing strategy (HNSW, GIN, B-tree)
- ✅ Data validation constraints and business rules
- ✅ Full-text search support
- ✅ Cross-service compatibility (Hono/Drizzle + Elixir/Ecto)
- ✅ Migration framework with rollback support
- ✅ Schema validation testing suite

**Technical Highlights:**
- HNSW indexes for efficient vector similarity search
- GIN indexes for full-text search across event content
- Normalized name fields for deduplication
- Confidence scoring for AI extraction quality
- Quality scoring for data validation
- Comprehensive constraint validation
- Production-ready migration tooling
