### Completion Notes (2025-08-13)
**Task completed by agent-003**

**Deliverables:**
1. **CI/CD Audit Report** (`ci-cd-audit-report.md`): Comprehensive assessment of current state and missing components
2. **GitHub Actions Recommendations** (`github-actions-recommendations.md`): Complete CI/CD pipeline workflows
3. **Environment Separation Guide** (`environment-separation-guide.md`): Strategy for dev/staging/prod isolation
4. **Staging Docker Configuration** (`docker-compose.staging.yml`): Ready-to-use staging environment

**Key Findings:**
- Current Docker configurations are well-structured but lack CI/CD automation
- No existing GitHub Actions workflows or automated testing
- Environment separation exists but needs staging environment implementation
- Security scanning and automated quality checks are missing

**Immediate Recommendations:**
1. Implement GitHub Actions CI pipeline with security scanning
2. Set up staging environment using provided configuration
3. Add automated testing infrastructure
4. Configure branch protection rules

**Risk Mitigation:**
- High risk of deployment failures due to manual processes
- Security vulnerabilities may go undetected without automated scanning
- Staging environment needed for production validation

All requirements have been completed with actionable recommendations provided.
