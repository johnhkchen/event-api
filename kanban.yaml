        task status prevents proper project completion assessment, blocks resource allocation decisions, and creates

  risk_mitigation_priority:
    rationale: |
      RISK-* tickets receive CRITICAL priority to address technical debt and 
      project risks that could impact development velocity or quality.
    current_risks:
      RISK-001: Redundant bash scripts causing confusion
      RISK-002: Kanban accuracy ensuring proper task tracking
      RISK-003: CI/CD readiness for automated deployment

    parallel_development: |
      After database foundation (DB-FEAT-001, DB-FEAT-002), Hono and Elixir 
      streams can proceed in parallel, reducing overall timeline from 914 
      sequential hours to approximately 400-500 hours with 2-3 parallel teams.
