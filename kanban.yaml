          - Docker path mismatches prevent development environment setup
          - Internal API endpoints missing block service communication

      validation_summary: |
        COMPREHENSIVE VALIDATION COMPLETED - 27 tasks moved to Done section, 4 new critical backfill tasks created.

        KEY FINDINGS:
        - Infrastructure foundation is 85% complete with excellent database schema and migration framework
        - Hono service implementation is significantly more complete than expected - production-ready features
        - Elixir service has excellent infrastructure foundation but needs business logic implementation
        - BAML service is completely missing despite being referenced throughout
        - Docker environment has critical path mismatches preventing container builds
        - AGE graph extension needs proper implementation beyond conditional installation

        MOVED TO DONE (27 tasks): All RISK mitigation, most DB-FEAT tasks, all Hono service features,
        authentication/security, planning tasks, review tasks, and administrative tasks.

        KEPT IN REVIEW (4 tasks): DB-FEAT-001 (AGE completion needed), DB-FEAT-004 (path fixes),
        BACKFILL-003 (Elixir business logic), BACKFILL-006 (Docker path fixes).

        NEW BACKFILL TASKS CREATED (4 tasks):
        - BACKFILL-004-VALIDATED: Implement Missing BAML Service (Critical - 32h)
        - BACKFILL-AGE-GRAPH: Complete AGE Graph Extension (High - 24h)
        - BACKFILL-DOCKER-PATHS: Fix Docker Path References (High - 8h)
        - ELIXIR-SCHEMAS-IMPL: Implement Elixir Schemas & Controllers (High - 32h)

        PROJECT STATUS: Strong foundation established, ready for focused implementation of identified gaps.

      validation_summary: |
        COMPREHENSIVE SERVICE REVIEW COMPLETED - Validated 12 core service implementation tasks.

        KEY FINDINGS:
        - Hono API service is PRODUCTION-READY with exceptional implementation quality
        - All 4 major Hono features (web scraping, CRUD API, search API, Elixir integration) fully implemented
        - Elixir service has excellent infrastructure but missing business logic (15-20% complete)
        - BAML service completely missing (0% implementation) - correctly identified in BACKFILL-004-VALIDATED
        - Service communication broken due to missing Elixir internal endpoints

        VERIFIED COMPLETE (Already in Done section):
        - HONO-FEAT-003: Web scraping engine with Playwright, ethical scraping, rate limiting
        - HONO-FEAT-004: Complete CRUD API with validation, pagination, batch operations
        - HONO-FEAT-005: Vector search with pgvector, full-text search capabilities
        - HONO-FEAT-007: HTTP client with retry logic, health checks, processing queue
        - All planning tasks (PLAN-001, PLAN-002), reviews (REV-001/002/003), and admin tasks

        CRITICAL GAPS VALIDATED:
        - ELIXIR-FEAT-009: Internal API endpoints missing (0% complete) - updated with validation notes
        - BACKFILL-004-VALIDATED: BAML service missing - correctly in progress with agent-001
        - ELIXIR-SCHEMAS-IMPL: Database schemas missing - correctly prioritized in backlog

        SERVICE INTEGRATION STATUS:
        - Hono → Elixir: HTTP client complete but all target endpoints missing (404s)
        - Elixir → BAML: Integration code exists but BAML service doesn't exist
        - Test failures due to missing dependencies and connectivity issues

        TASK ACCURACY: Kanban status is highly accurate with proper task positioning.
        No tasks needed to be moved - existing backfill tasks correctly identify all gaps.

      priority: P1 (Normal)
      rationale: System validation and production readiness
      depends_on: All foundation streams
      key_deliverables:
        - End-to-end workflow testing
        - Performance and load testing
        - Monitoring and observability
        - Production readiness checklist
    stream_5_deployment:
      priority: P2 (Low)
      rationale: Production deployment automation
      depends_on: Integration testing complete
      key_deliverables:
        - Flox production containers
        - Coolify deployment pipeline
        - GitHub Actions workflow
        - Production environment hardening
  risk_mitigation_priority:
    rationale: |
      RISK-* tickets receive CRITICAL priority to address technical debt and 
      project risks that could impact development velocity or quality.
    current_risks:
      RISK-001: Redundant bash scripts causing confusion
      RISK-002: Kanban accuracy ensuring proper task tracking
      RISK-003: CI/CD readiness for automated deployment

    parallel_development: |
      After database foundation (DB-FEAT-001, DB-FEAT-002), Hono and Elixir 
      streams can proceed in parallel, reducing overall timeline from 914 
      sequential hours to approximately 400-500 hours with 2-3 parallel teams.
