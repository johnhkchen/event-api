      title: Critical Workflow System Enhancement - Prevent Agent Confusion and SOP Violations
      priority: critical
      estimated_hours: 16
      description: >-
        Comprehensive overhaul of workflow system to eliminate agent confusion about command locations and prevent
        Standard Operating Procedure violations. Critical fixes to prevent agents from working outside their assigned
        worktrees and causing workflow breakdowns.
      requirements:
        - >-
          Command Guardrails Implementation: Add reminder commands (just complete, just done) in base directory justfile
          that redirect agents to their proper agent directories with clear instructions
        - >-
          Base Directory Protection: Implement safeguards in base justfile to prevent agents from running workflow
          commands outside their designated worktrees
        - >-
          Comprehensive Workflow Audit: Review entire workflow system (justfile, scripts/, documentation) to identify
          and fix similar missing guardrails and confusion points
        - >-
          Agent Workspace Enforcement: Strengthen isolation system to prevent agents from deleting each other's
          branches, overwriting work, or accessing other agents' worktrees
        - >-
          SOP Enhancement: Update Standard Operating Procedures with clearer workspace rules, validation steps, and
          early warning systems for workflow violations
        - >-
          Command Location Validation: Add checks in agent-work.ts and agent-manager.ts to validate commands are run
          from correct locations with helpful error messages
        - >-
          Workflow Documentation Update: Update all workflow documentation to clarify proper command usage and agent
          workspace boundaries
        - >-
          Testing and Validation: Test all workflow scenarios to ensure agents cannot accidentally violate workspace
          isolation or delete other agents' work
      files:
        - /home/jchen/repos/event-api/justfile (add guardian commands)

        Agent workspace confusion is causing critical workflow violations including command location errors, potential
        data loss from agents deleting each other's branches, and Standard Operating Procedure breakdowns. Without
        proper guardrails, agents risk overwriting work, working outside designated areas, and causing project delays.
        This is blocking efficient concurrent development and threatens project stability.
      validation_status: >-
        CRITICAL WORKFLOW VIOLATION RISK - Agents getting confused about where to run just complete/done commands,
        leading to SOP violations and potential workspace contamination. Immediate implementation of guardrails required
        to prevent data loss and maintain development workflow integrity.

prioritization_strategy:
  sequence_rationale: |
    The project follows a multi-stream development approach based on the detailed 
    specifications in tickets/. Tasks are prioritized to enable parallel development
    while respecting critical dependencies.
  development_streams:
    stream_1_database:
      priority: P0 (High)
      rationale: Foundation layer required by all other services
      blocking_tasks: All Hono and Elixir development
      key_deliverables:
        - PostgreSQL with pgvector + AGE extensions
        - Complete schema with relationships
        - Docker Compose development environment
        - Migration framework
    stream_2_hono_api:
      priority: P1 (Normal)
      rationale: User-facing API service for external interfaces
      depends_on: Database foundation
      key_deliverables:
        - Web scraping system (Playwright)
        - Event CRUD API endpoints
        - Search and discovery functionality
        - Integration with Elixir service
    stream_3_elixir_processing:
      priority: P1 (Normal)
      rationale: Complex data processing and intelligence engine
      depends_on: Database foundation
      key_deliverables:
        - Event processing pipeline (GenServer)
        - BAML integration for data extraction
        - Deduplication engine
        - Graph relationships and recommendations
    stream_4_integration:
      priority: P1 (Normal)
      rationale: System validation and production readiness
      depends_on: All foundation streams
      key_deliverables:
        - End-to-end workflow testing
        - Performance and load testing
        - Monitoring and observability
        - Production readiness checklist
    stream_5_deployment:
      priority: P2 (Low)
      rationale: Production deployment automation
      depends_on: Integration testing complete
      key_deliverables:
        - Flox production containers
        - Coolify deployment pipeline
        - GitHub Actions workflow
        - Production environment hardening
  risk_mitigation_priority:
    rationale: |
      RISK-* tickets receive CRITICAL priority to address technical debt and 
      project risks that could impact development velocity or quality.
    current_risks:
      RISK-001: Redundant bash scripts causing confusion
      RISK-002: Kanban accuracy ensuring proper task tracking
      RISK-003: CI/CD readiness for automated deployment
  estimated_timeline:
    total_hours: 914
    database_foundation: 144
    hono_api_service: 182
    elixir_processing: 216
    integration_testing: 144
    deployment_pipeline: 60
    risk_mitigation: 15
    parallel_development: |
      After database foundation (DB-FEAT-001, DB-FEAT-002), Hono and Elixir 
      streams can proceed in parallel, reducing overall timeline from 914 
      sequential hours to approximately 400-500 hours with 2-3 parallel teams.
