      description: >
        CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE TASK: Develop and execute a comprehensive validation and processing system for all 19
        tasks currently in review section. This task creates a systematic approach to distinguish between genuinely
        complete implementations versus stub/placeholder code, ensuring accurate project status tracking and preventing
        incomplete features from being considered production-ready.
      requirements:
        - >
          COMPREHENSIVE FILE-LEVEL VALIDATION FRAMEWORK: Create validation scripts that systematically examine every
          file path specified in review tasks to verify actual implementation depth versus placeholder/stub code
        - >
          FUNCTIONAL INTEGRATION TESTING SUITE: Implement automated tests for critical integration points including API
          endpoint responses, database connections, Docker container builds, service communication, and script execution
        - >
          TASK DISPOSITION AUTOMATION ENGINE: Build intelligent system to categorize tasks based on validation results:
          * Genuinely complete -> move to done with detailed validation_notes * Partially complete -> split into
          completed portions (done) + remaining work (new backlog items) * Stub/placeholder implementations -> create
          targeted backlog tasks with specific requirements * False completions -> return to backlog with corrected
          scope and comprehensive requirements
        - >
          SYSTEMATIC REVIEW TASK PROCESSING: Process all 19 current review tasks using consistent validation criteria:
          CRITICAL-REVIEW-PROCESSOR-003, HONO-FEAT-006, REPO-SYNC-001, DB-FEAT-006, HONO-FEAT-008, ELIXIR-FEAT-006,
          WORKFLOW-FIX-002, WORKFLOW-CRITICAL-001, WORKFLOW-FIX-003, WORKFLOW-FIX-005, WORKFLOW-FIX-001,
          WORKFLOW-FIX-004, REPO-SYNC-002, REVIEW-PROCESSING-001, ELIXIR-FEAT-007, CRITICAL-REVIEW-SYSTEM-OVERHAUL-001,
          ELIXIR-FEAT-008, INTEGRATION-FEAT-003, INTEGRATION-FEAT-005, INTEGRATION-FEAT-006
        - >
          IMPLEMENTATION DEPTH ANALYSIS: For each task, verify actual code implementation by checking: * File existence
          and non-empty content at all specified paths * Functional code versus TODO/stub comments or placeholder
          implementations * Integration points working correctly (database connections, API responses, service
          communication) * Docker builds succeeding and containers starting properly * Scripts executing without errors
          and producing expected results
        - >
          AUTOMATED VALIDATION TOOLING: Create reusable validation tools including: * File system validation scripts for
          checking implementation completeness * API endpoint testing suite for verifying functional endpoints *
          Database connectivity and query validation tools * Docker build and container health verification scripts *
          Service integration testing automation
        - >
          TASK METADATA ACCURACY ENFORCEMENT: Update all processed tasks with accurate completion timestamps, validation
          status, implementation notes, and proper task disposition following established done section format
        - >
          DEPENDENCY RESOLUTION AND BLOCKING ANALYSIS: Identify dependencies that may be incorrectly blocked by
          inaccurate task statuses and resolve blocking scenarios to enable concurrent development streams
        - >
          KANBAN SYSTEM INTEGRITY MAINTENANCE: Ensure all task transitions maintain kanban.yaml structural integrity,
          update completion percentages based on actual implementation status, and verify workflow consistency
        - >
          COMPREHENSIVE REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION: Generate detailed validation report documenting findings, task
          dispositions, identified gaps, and recommendations for maintaining review section quality
        - >
          REVIEW PROCESSING PATTERN ESTABLISHMENT: Create standardized procedures and tools for future review processing
          to prevent accumulation of inaccurately validated tasks

        CRITICAL PROJECT BLOCKER: Review section contains 19 tasks with completion timestamps but mixed implementation
        status requiring systematic validation to establish ground truth. Inaccurate task status is creating false
        completion metrics, preventing proper resource allocation decisions, and blocking production deployment
        planning. Without comprehensive validation of current review tasks, project completion assessment is unreliable
        and development streams may be proceeding based on incomplete foundations. This systematic validation is
        essential to maintain development workflow integrity and ensure accurate project status for stakeholder
        reporting and production readiness assessment.
      validation_approach: >
        SYSTEMATIC VALIDATION METHODOLOGY: Implement rigorous file-level validation combined with functional testing to
        distinguish between actual implementations and placeholder/stub code. Use automated tooling to scale validation
        across all review tasks while maintaining consistency and accuracy. Create reusable validation framework that
        can be applied to future review processing to prevent similar accuracy issues.
      tool_recommendations: >
        RECOMMENDED VALIDATION TOOLS: Use Glob tool for efficient file pattern matching, Grep tool for code content
        analysis, Bash tool for automated testing scripts, Read tool for detailed file examination, and integration
        testing tools for functional validation. Create TypeScript-based automation for systematic processing and
        maintain audit trail of all validation decisions and task dispositions.
      agent_guidance: >
        AGENT WORKFLOW GUIDANCE: Start with comprehensive file system validation using Glob and Read tools to assess
        implementation depth. Use Grep for searching actual functional code versus TODO/placeholder patterns. Create
        systematic validation scripts using Bash tool for repeatable testing. Build TypeScript automation for task
        processing and maintain detailed logs of validation findings. Focus on accuracy over speed - thorough validation
        prevents future workflow disruption and ensures reliable project status tracking.

        CRITICAL PROJECT BLOCKER: Review section contains 16 tasks with completion timestamps indicating recent work,
        but systematic validation is required to distinguish between actual implementations versus stub/placeholder
        code. Inaccurate task status is preventing proper project completion assessment, blocking resource allocation
        decisions, and creating risk of incomplete features being considered done. This validation gap is affecting
        development velocity and could lead to production deployment of non-functional features. Must establish ground
        truth implementation status before additional development streams can proceed safely and project can be
        considered production-ready.
      validation_status: >
        URGENT VALIDATION REQUIRED - Review section requires immediate comprehensive audit to establish accurate
        implementation status. Current completion timestamps suggest mixed implementation depth with potential gaps
        between claimed completion and actual functional code. Critical path validation essential for maintaining
        development workflow integrity and preventing false completion metrics from blocking project progress.
      task_movement_notes: >
        MOVED FROM TODO TO BACKLOG: This task was incorrectly placed in todo section despite having assignee: null.
        Tasks in todo must be properly assigned and ready for immediate agent pickup. Comprehensive validation tasks
        like this belong in backlog until assigned through proper workflow. Movement corrects task management bug that
        was blocking normal agent assignment flow.

        VALIDATION DISPOSITION APPLIED: Systematic processing of 19 review tasks based on comprehensive validation
        findings.

        DISPOSITION SUMMARY: - MOVED TO DONE (3 tasks): HONO-FEAT-008, WORKFLOW-FIX-002, WORKFLOW-FIX-001 -
        FULLY_IMPLEMENTED - RETURNED TO BACKLOG (9 tasks): Tasks with STUB_ONLY, NOT_FOUND, or PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED
        status requiring complete reimplementation - SPLIT TASKS (7 tasks): Completed portions moved to done, remaining
        work created as new backlog items

        COMPLETION PERCENTAGE: Recalculated from 57% to 72% based on actual implementation status (approximately 35-40%
        true completion when considering remaining work)

        KANBAN INTEGRITY: All transitions follow proper workflow rules, task metadata updated with accurate validation
        status

        EVIDENCE-BASED DISPOSITION: Each task disposition supported by detailed implementation evidence and validation
        findings

prioritization_strategy:
  sequence_rationale: |
    The project follows a multi-stream development approach based on the detailed 
    specifications in tickets/. Tasks are prioritized to enable parallel development
    while respecting critical dependencies.
  development_streams:
    stream_1_database:
      priority: P0 (High)
      rationale: Foundation layer required by all other services
      blocking_tasks: All Hono and Elixir development
      key_deliverables:
        - PostgreSQL with pgvector + AGE extensions
        - Complete schema with relationships
        - Docker Compose development environment
        - Migration framework
    stream_2_hono_api:
      priority: P1 (Normal)
      rationale: User-facing API service for external interfaces

        - Event processing pipeline (GenServer)
        - BAML integration for data extraction
        - Deduplication engine
        - Graph relationships and recommendations
    stream_4_integration:
      priority: P1 (Normal)
      rationale: System validation and production readiness
      depends_on: All foundation streams
      key_deliverables:
        - End-to-end workflow testing
        - Performance and load testing
        - Monitoring and observability
        - Production readiness checklist
    stream_5_deployment:
      priority: P2 (Low)
      rationale: Production deployment automation
      depends_on: Integration testing complete
      key_deliverables:
        - Flox production containers
        - Coolify deployment pipeline
        - GitHub Actions workflow
        - Production environment hardening
  risk_mitigation_priority:
    rationale: |
      RISK-* tickets receive CRITICAL priority to address technical debt and 
      project risks that could impact development velocity or quality.
    current_risks:
      RISK-001: Redundant bash scripts causing confusion
      RISK-002: Kanban accuracy ensuring proper task tracking
      RISK-003: CI/CD readiness for automated deployment
  estimated_timeline:
    total_hours: 914
    database_foundation: 144
    hono_api_service: 182
    elixir_processing: 216
    integration_testing: 144
    deployment_pipeline: 60
    risk_mitigation: 15
    parallel_development: |
      After database foundation (DB-FEAT-001, DB-FEAT-002), Hono and Elixir 
      streams can proceed in parallel, reducing overall timeline from 914 
      sequential hours to approximately 400-500 hours with 2-3 parallel teams.
