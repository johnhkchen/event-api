prioritization_strategy:
  sequence_rationale: |
    The project follows a multi-stream development approach based on the detailed 
    specifications in tickets/. Tasks are prioritized to enable parallel development
    while respecting critical dependencies.
  development_streams:
    stream_1_database:
      priority: P0 (High)
      rationale: Foundation layer required by all other services
      blocking_tasks: All Hono and Elixir development
      key_deliverables:
        - PostgreSQL with pgvector + AGE extensions
        - Complete schema with relationships
        - Docker Compose development environment
        - Migration framework
    stream_2_hono_api:
      priority: P1 (Normal)
      rationale: User-facing API service for external interfaces
      depends_on: Database foundation
      key_deliverables:
        - Web scraping system (Playwright)
        - Event CRUD API endpoints
        - Search and discovery functionality
        - Integration with Elixir service
    stream_3_elixir_processing:
      priority: P1 (Normal)
      rationale: Complex data processing and intelligence engine
      depends_on: Database foundation
      key_deliverables:
        - Event processing pipeline (GenServer)
        - BAML integration for data extraction
        - Deduplication engine
        - Graph relationships and recommendations
    stream_4_integration:
      priority: P1 (Normal)
      rationale: System validation and production readiness
      depends_on: All foundation streams
      key_deliverables:
        - End-to-end workflow testing
        - Performance and load testing
        - Monitoring and observability
        - Production readiness checklist
    stream_5_deployment:
      priority: P2 (Low)
      rationale: Production deployment automation
      depends_on: Integration testing complete
      key_deliverables:
        - Flox production containers
        - Coolify deployment pipeline
        - GitHub Actions workflow
        - Production environment hardening
  risk_mitigation_priority:
    rationale: |
      RISK-* tickets receive CRITICAL priority to address technical debt and 
      project risks that could impact development velocity or quality.
    current_risks:
      RISK-001: Redundant bash scripts causing confusion
      RISK-002: Kanban accuracy ensuring proper task tracking
      RISK-003: CI/CD readiness for automated deployment
  estimated_timeline:
    total_hours: 914
    database_foundation: 144
    hono_api_service: 182
    elixir_processing: 216
    integration_testing: 144
    deployment_pipeline: 60
    risk_mitigation: 15
    parallel_development: |
      After database foundation (DB-FEAT-001, DB-FEAT-002), Hono and Elixir 
      streams can proceed in parallel, reducing overall timeline from 914 
      sequential hours to approximately 400-500 hours with 2-3 parallel teams.
