# Status - Flox MCP Automation Setup ✅ COMPLETED

## Completed Tasks

✅ **Flox Environment Initialized**
- Flox environment already initialized in `.flox/` directory
- Basic configuration in place

✅ **MCP Automation Configured**
- Added hook in `manifest.toml` to automatically verify/setup MCP context7 server
- Implements best practices from Flox conference talk attendee notes
- Includes environment verification, dependency checking, and status tracking

✅ **Automation Features**
- Smart detection: checks if MCP server already exists before attempting setup
- Status tracking: uses `.mcp_setup_complete` file to avoid repeated setup
- Error handling: provides manual command if automation fails
- Cross-platform compatibility: uses Flox's bash interpreter
- Reproducible environment: follows agent-based coding workflow principles

✅ **Testing Verified**
- Automation works on fresh environment activation
- Properly detects existing MCP servers
- Creates status file to track completion
- Environment ready message confirms all systems operational

## Environment Benefits
- **Reproducible**: Other developers can `flox activate` and get identical setup
- **Cross-platform**: Works on macOS, Linux (ARM/x86-64)
- **Automated**: No manual MCP setup required after first activation
- **Shareable**: Environment can be shared via Flox Hub
- **CI-ready**: Can be integrated into GitHub Actions workflows

## Usage
```bash
cd /home/jchen/repos/event-api
flox activate  # Automatically verifies/sets up MCP context7 server
```

The automation eliminates the manual 1-minute setup step and ensures consistent development environments for the Event Data API project.
